## This module contains various techniques for special function evaluation, e.g.
## power series, continued fractions, polynomial & Pad√© approximation, etc.

  ## Continued fraction evaluator by modified Lentz method.  This is a template
  ## in terms of templates `num(n)` ,`den(n)` since continued fraction series
  ## have variadix mixed type (int/float) inputs.  Leaving all that type/param
  ## count fixing to a parent proc/func seems an ok way to abstract over that.
  ## NOTE: num(n) and den(n) are indexed starting from 1 as this is the common
  ## convention for series coefficient formulae.
